    "### FIAT: Framework for Iterative and Agnostic Testing of Hydrological Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to run a simple test case using **FIAT** – the *Framework for Iterative and Agnostic Testing of Hydrological Models*. FIAT is designed to help hydrologists and model developers systematically evaluate models under a variety of conditions, while remaining agnostic to the specific model implementation or numerical core. The goal is to provide a common, reproducible workflow for running and analyzing iterative test cases (e.g., autocalibration experiments) across different hydrological modeling platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will walk through the typical FIAT workflow for a single test case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining or selecting a test case (e.g., a simple catchment or benchmark configuration).\n",
    "2. Configuring the model setup and FIAT test specification.\n",
    "3. Running the test case through FIAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis here is on the **testing workflow**, not on any one model’s physics or numerical scheme. By separating the test definition from the model implementation, FIAT makes it easier to experiment with calibration test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along with this notebook, you should have FIAT installed in your Python environment (for example, via `pip` or from source) and be familiar with basic Python and Jupyter usage. The test case we use here is intentionally simple, so that the focus remains on understanding how FIAT orchestrates the run, rather than on complex data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will import FIAT, inspect the available test cases, and configure the one we want to run."

    "### Installation\n",

    "FIAT is currently developed on GitHub and can be installed directly from the repository. To follow this notebook, first make sure you have a recent version of Python (e.g., 3.10+) and `pip` available, then run:\n",

    "### Test case: Wolf Creek Research Basin with MESH and Ostrich\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on a specific application of FIAT: testing the **Wolf Creek Research Basin** using the **MESH** hydrological model and the **Ostrich** optimization framework. The aim is to demonstrate how FIAT can orchestrate a full calibration workflow, where a model (MESH) is repeatedly run under the control of an external optimizer (Ostrich) to improve model parameters against observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIAT creates a **calibration test case** that encapsulates all of the information needed for this workflow: the model configuration, the parameter space to explore, the objective function, and the links to the forcing and observation data for the Wolf Creek basin. Once this test case is defined, FIAT uses Ostrich’s internal optimization algorithms to systematically adjust the MESH parameters. For each candidate parameter set, FIAT triggers a MESH simulation, collects the performance metrics, and passes them back to Ostrich.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iterating in this way, FIAT effectively wraps MESH inside an optimization loop driven by Ostrich. This allows us to treat the calibration as a reproducible, well-defined test case: one that can be rerun, compared across model versions or configurations, and extended to other basins with minimal changes to the workflow."

MESHFlow provides a set of utilities and workflows to set up and manage MESH model configurations, which FIAT then uses to define and run the Wolf Creek test case.

    "\n",
    "- The **model interface** (MESH, accessed via MESHFlow),\n",

    "- The **objective function** and evaluation period,\n",
    "- Any **runtime options** (e.g., maximum iterations, convergence criteria, random seeds).\n",

    "- Which parameters are free to vary during calibration (and their bounds),\n",
    "- How performance is measured (e.g., Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, log-NSE, bias),\n",
    "- Practical limits on the optimization (number of evaluations, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cells, we will focus on describing the **parameter space** as required by FIAT for a MESH–Ostrich calibration. This parameter definition is passed into the `Calibration` object so that FIAT can hand off candidate parameter sets to MESHFlow, MESH, and ultimately Ostrich.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parameter dictionaries for MESH\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate MESH, FIAT's MESH recipe expects parameter information to be organized into **three distinct parameter dictionaries**. Each dictionary is keyed by **computational unit identifiers**, and each key maps to a dictionary of parameters and their search bounds. The three dictionaries correspond to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CLASS parameters**  \n",
    "2. **Hydrology parameters**  \n",
    "3. **Routing parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **CLASS** and **hydrology** parameter dictionaries, the computational unit is the **Group Response Unit (GRU)**. For the **routing** parameter dictionary, the computational units are the **river classes**, with a maximum of 5 distinct river classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary keys: computational unit indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parameter dictionary uses **integer keys** starting from 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For CLASS and hydrology parameters:\n",
    "  - Key `1` corresponds to the first GRU,\n",
    "  - Key `2` to the second GRU,\n",
    "  - …\n",
    "  - Key `N` to the last GRU, where `N` is the total number of GRUs defined for the model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For routing parameters:\n",
    "  - Key `1` corresponds to the first river class,\n",
    "  - Key `2` to the second river class,\n",
    "  - …\n",
    "  - Up to a maximum of **5** river classes (i.e., keys `1` through `5`, or fewer if the model uses fewer river classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for each MESH instance, FIAT assumes a well-defined mapping between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GRU indices (`1..N`) and their physical meaning (land cover, soil type, etc.), and  \n",
    "- River class indices (`1..R`) and their routing properties (`R ≤ 5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary values: parameter definitions and bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "For **each computational unit**, the corresponding value in the dictionary is **another dictionary** that defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **parameter names** for that unit (e.g., `SDEP`, `QA50`, or hydrological/routing parameters specific to MESH), and  \n",
    "- The **search bounds** for each parameter during calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this often looks like a nested structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outer dictionary is keyed by the computational unit index (GRU or river class number), and\n",
    "- The inner dictionary maps each parameter name to its lower and upper bounds (and optionally additional metadata, depending on the FIAT API).\n",
    "\n",
    "FIAT then uses these nested dictionaries to construct the calibration parameter space passed to Ostrich. For each Ostrich iteration, FIAT will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw or receive a candidate parameter set within the specified bounds for each computational unit,\n",
    "2. Write the corresponding MESH configuration files via MESHFlow,\n",
    "3. Run MESH,\n",
    "4. Evaluate the objective function, and\n",
    "5. Return the performance metric to Ostrich.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following of the notebook, we will define these three parameter dictionaries with parameters we would like to calibrate for the Wolf Creek Research Basin setup and pass them into the FIAT `Calibration` object."
