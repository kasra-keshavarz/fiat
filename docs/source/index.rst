Welcome to FIAT's documentation!
================================
FIAT (Framework for Iterative and Agnostic Testing) is designed for existing
hydrological models and iterative testing software programs in the community. It aims
to crowdsource recipes for both hydrological models and calibration software programs
to facilitate model calibration, evaluation, and uncertainty analysis. In other
words, FIAT couples the models to iterative testing software programs in a
systematic and standardized manner.

Many hydrological models need fine-tuning and (auto-)calibration to perform well
and FIAT aims to reduce the burden of setting up these calibration experiments.
